  <strong> Modular Data Driven Physics, Render and Data Science Engine </strong> for the rust programming language.
</p>

-----

### Goals:

- **Speed**: *fast* and *parallel* Architecture
- **Feature Complete**: Offers many built in algorithms, simulations and components (not yet)
- **Modularity**: use only what you need or replace it with your own implementation
- **Simple**: Easy to learn and very flexible for advanced users
- **Data Oriented**: The Architecture is based on Legion ECS

  <strong> Warning: </strong> this project is under heavy development and not really usable from a consumer-perspective 
  right now. Expect many breaking updates as architecture is not decided yet.
